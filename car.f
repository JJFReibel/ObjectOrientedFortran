! Subroutines and functions were not introduced to Fortran until Fortran II, and array programming was not introduced until Fortran 90. Common file extension of Fortran 90 is .f90. Use Fortran 90 compiler to see in action. Original Fortran had no functions, subroutines, procedures, methods.... And so OOP in Fortran I is therefore essentially impossible, as only number types and mathematical operations are possible.
